# ParkingOccupancyDetection
Parking occupancy detection has always been something important when we want to create smart parking solutions. That's why I've been working on this repository to enable you two possible solutions, one on the edge (execute it on your device) or in a cloud provider (in this case I'll be using AWS). In both cases you will find two scripts, one made for spot detection (detects where spots are) and the second one, will be the parking occupancy detector which will be running all time detecting vehicle presence and having a list of free/occupied parking spots.

As you have noticed by now, using a cloud provider to recognize images it'll always be better for accuracy but maybe in your case accuracy is not important as being fast. That's why I'm providing you both solutions! 

Note that for executing this recognition you'll need to have a valid USB camera for your laptop / raspberry pi / etc!
