# REQUIREMENTS

In this case you'll need to have an AWS account in order to proceed. As long as you have it set up correctly that's all you'll have to need except for python3:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

And, lastly, give execution permissions to the script which will start the service:

```
chmod +x setup_parking_camera_detector.sh
```

And now, you'll be able to launch it and set it up following the cmd instructions!
